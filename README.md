# logictools

We help to study logic solvers by providing and collecting various 
easy-to-use, browser-based javascript tools: starting with classical propositional formulas 
and continuing with predicate logic later.

The focus is on simplicity, ease of use, hacking and experimenting, 
not state of the art efficiency-wise.

Help and cooperation appreciated for improving the current code, writing and proposing new tools, etc. 
See <a href="http://logictools.org">the site with functioning code</a>.
